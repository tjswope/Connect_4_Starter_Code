  # Functions for evaluating the board. These functions will be used by the minimax algorithm.
  # this function will get the score!

  #For my minimax algorithm I start by checking to see if there is going to be a winner.
  # If there are three in a row, the score is set to infinity, telling the AI that the opponentâ€™s score will win if it is not blocked.
  # This results in the AI blocking.
  # Then, it loops through the board, checking for how many there are in a row horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, giving a score of 10 for every 2 in a row, adding to the score if three in a row is reached.
  # The AI looks to minimize the score, getting as many in a row as it can, blocks the player when it has three in a row, and makes sure it will not make a move that allows the player to place off of it and win (unless unavoidable).
